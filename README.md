# msys2_wrapper

A Python wrapper for starting msys2 without bat

## Prereq

Has installed MSYS2 at disk root (e.g. `C:/msys64`), or `msys2.cmd` or `msys2_shell.cmd` can be found in PATH.

also supports scoop-installed msys2.

In case of multiple MSYS2 detected, it will launch the first found in `PATH`, and if not found, `C:/msys64` was checked, until `Z:/msys64`.

You can also create a file `C:/Users/[your user name]/.config/msys2_wrapper.ini` to override the default, with the following contents:
```ini
[default]
msys2_base = "D:/msys64"
```
